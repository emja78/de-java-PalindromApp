# de-java-PalindromApp
command line tool to validate palindromic words

You'll need Maven to run unit tests and build a runnable jar. Please call 'maven package'.

The runnable jar is builded into the subfolder ./target.

Please run this jar from the command line and add your test words as parameters. E.G.: 

java -jar PalindromChecker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar anna test 

Best regards
